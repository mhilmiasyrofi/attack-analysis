# Contributing to Nemesis

Adding new features, improving documentation, fixing bugs, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions. Furthermore, if you are publishing a new attack or defense, we strongly encourage you to add it to Adversarial Robustness Toolbox so that others may evaluate it fairly in their own work.

Bug fixes can be initiated through Github pull requests. When making code contributions to Adversarial Robustness Toolbox, we ask that you follow the `PEP 8` coding standard and that you provide unit tests for the new features.
