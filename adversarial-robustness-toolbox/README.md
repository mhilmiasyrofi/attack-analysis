# Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) 
This code is directly forked from [ART Repository] (https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox). At that time, there are several bug when we use PyPI version of this library. Thus we decide to modify code directly from the source.

### How To Generate Adversarial Examples

```
bash generate.sh
```
*TO DO:* add output dir parameter

This script will generate adversarial examples from each adversarial attack. The adversarial examples are saved at `<root-project>/adversarial_examples`
