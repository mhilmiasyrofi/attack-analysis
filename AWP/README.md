# AWP for Adversarial Training
Adversarial training codes originated from [Adversarial Weight Perturbation](https://github.com/csdongxian/AWP) 


## RQ3

### Clustering Analysis

Running command for adversarial training
```
bash train-rq1.sh
```
This script will generate trained models that is saved at `<fpath>`

Run evaluation using the trained models
```
bash eval-rq1.sh
```
This script will .... generate log on `<fpath>`

Clustering analysis: `clustering-analysis-rq1.ipynb`


### Best-performing model

Best performing model analysis: `best-performing-model-analysis.ipynb`


### Ensemble Model

Running command for adversarial training
```
bash train-rq1.sh
```
This script will generate trained models that is saved at `<fpath>`

Run evaluation using the trained models
```
bash eval-rq1.sh
