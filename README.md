This is a library dedicated to **adversarial machine learning**. Its purpose is to allow rapid crafting and analysis of attacks and defense methods for machine learning models. ART provides an implementation for many state-of-the-art methods for attacking and defending classifiers.

The library is still under development. Feedback, bug reports and extensions are highly appreciated. Get in touch with us on [Slack](https://ibm-art.slack.com) (invite [here](https://join.slack.com/t/ibm-art/shared_invite/enQtMzkyOTkyODE4NzM4LTlkMWY3MzgyZDA4ZDdiNzUzY2NhMjc5YmFhZTYzZGYwNDM4YTE1ODhhNDYyNmFlMGFjNWY4ODgyM2EwYTFjYTc))!

## Setup

### Installation with `pip`

The toolbox is designed and tested to run with Python 3. 
ART can be installed from the PyPi repository using `pip`:

```bash
pip install adversarial-robustness-toolbox
```

### Manual installation

For the most recent version of the library, either download the source code or clone the repository in your directory of choice:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/adversarial-robustness-toolbox
```

To install ART, do the following in the project folder:
```bash
pip install .
```

The library comes with a basic set of unit tests. To check your install, you can run all the unit tests by calling the test script in the install folder:

```bash
bash run_tests.sh
```

## Running ART

Some examples of how to use ART when writing your own code can be found in the `examples` folder. See `examples/README.md` for more information about what each example does. To run an example, use the following command:
```bash
python examples/<example_name>.py
```

The `notebooks` folder contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed walkthroughs of some usage scenarios. 

### Contributing

Adding new features, improving documentation, fixing bugs, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions. Furthermore, if you are publishing a new attack or defense, we strongly encourage you to add it to the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox so that others may evaluate it fairly in their own work.

Bug fixes can be initiated through GitHub pull requests. When making code contributions to the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox, we ask that you follow the `PEP 8` coding standard and that you provide unit tests for the new features.

This project uses [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/). Be sure to sign off your commits using the `-s` flag or adding `Signed-off-By: Name<Email>` in the commit message.

#### Example

```bash
git commit -s -m 'Add new feature'
```
