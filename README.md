Adversarial Robustness 360 Toolbox (ART) is a Python library supporting developers and researchers in defending Machine 
Learning models (Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, 
Logistic Regression, Gaussian Processes, Decision Trees, Scikit-learn Pipelines, etc.) against adversarial threats 
(including evasion, extraction and poisoning) and helps making AI systems more secure and trustworthy. Machine Learning 
models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are inputs (images, texts, tabular data, etc.) deliberately crafted 
to produce a desired response by the Machine Learning model. ART provides the tools to build and deploy defences and 
test them with adversarial attacks. 

Defending Machine Learning models involves certifying and verifying model robustness and model hardening with 
approaches such as pre-processing inputs, augmenting training data with adversarial examples, and leveraging runtime 
detection methods to flag any inputs that might have been modified by an adversary. ART includes attacks for testing 
defenses with state-of-the-art threat models.
